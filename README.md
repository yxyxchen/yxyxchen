- I am a Ph.D. researcher in an interdisciplinary field (Neuroeconomics) and a freelance data scientist. 

- At work, I build human-like reinforcement learning models and develop tools that automate large-scale modeling analysis and data collection.

- In my free time, I enjoy learning mathematics/coding for fun, searching for the next good read, and shopping stationery with eye-pleasing colors.
